# Lisp-Interpreter
This is a final project that I created for my Concepts of Programming Languages class
at UCCS. It is an interpreter for a subset of the Lisp language. It includes
arithmetic expressions, logical operators, list operations, support for nested
expressions, and global, user-defined variables. It also uses C++ exceptions
to recover from user-entered syntax errors. Further details can be found in
the documentation file.

Local variables and user-defined functions are not supported at this time.

This program was developed on JGrasp with a MinGW compiler.
